- 👋 Hi, I’m @benol5en
- 👀 I’m interested in music, video, performance art, conceptual art, poetry, weird little things, "good" public art
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to music more, how to git/hub, how to document a circle in my front yard
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art projects that keep me up at night and maybe help people/society in some way
- 📫 How to reach me: github@benolsen.com 253-867-5309
